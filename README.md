# A-Path-Finding---Makeblock-Mbot

##Mbot uses A* algorithm in order to perform path finding

Created a program where the Mbot robot uses A* algorithm through the Arduino IDE in order to find the "best" 
path from the initial tile (tile 45) to the goal tile (chosen by user). 

The tile map is a 10x10 grid and virtual objects are placed in fixed positions.

Code contains informative comments on how this program is implemented.
