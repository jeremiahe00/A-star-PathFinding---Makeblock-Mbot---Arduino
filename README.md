# A-Path-Finding---Makeblock-Mbot

##Mbot uses A* algorithm in order to perform path finding

Created a program where the Mbot robot uses A* algorithm through the Arduino IDE in order to find the "best" 
path from the initial tile (tile 45) to the goal tile (chosen by user). 

The tile map is a 10x10 grid and virtual objects are placed in fixed positions.

Code contains informative comments on how this program is implemented.


## For those coming from my Resume or LinkedIn/Profile:

•	In pursuit of advancing our robotic capabilities, our primary objective centered on enabling our Makeblock mBot robot to autonomously navigate complex environments through the application of heuristic-driven pathfinding algorithms. 
•	Our solution was anchored in the integration of the A* search algorithm, a renowned AI-powered technique for efficient route planning. 
•	As the Team Lead and principal developer, I orchestrated the project, driving innovation and algorithmic excellence. 
•	Although the program exhibited commendable performance, there remained room for enhancements in terms of precision in movements and scalability, both crucial aspects in fine-tuning the algorithm's decision-making processes.
